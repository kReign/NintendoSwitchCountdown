# RedditSidebarCountdown
Countdown script originally made for /r/NintendoSwitch

See the original Reddit Countdown:

Reddit Countdown is written in an old version of PRAW. RedditSidebarCountdown was ported from that version to PRAW4 and had some functionality (like what format the sidebar needs to be in) changed.

TO USE:
Change the values in the config file and remove .sample
Make sure the name of the config file is specified in the script.
Run it and go! 

Soon it will be tied to update every hour on the hour (or day, minute, etc) rather than an hour after running it.
